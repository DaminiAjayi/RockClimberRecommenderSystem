text1 <- ("American rock climbing is enjoying a boom in popularity - ballooning to 4.6 million total climbers in 2016 (CBJ, 2016). 
                  The proliferation of rock climbing in recent years is exciting for both novices and seasoned climbers. 
                  The large influx of newcomers and intermediate climbers has created an information gap. 
                  More specifically, climbers may not have the information on how to advance their climbing skills efficiently and quickly, 
                  which local routes to climb, and what routes other climbers around their skill level are climbing.")

text2 <- ("With the growth in climbing comes a vast increase in data collected on the activity. 
                  In 2019, we have reached a critical mass of climbers which creates great potential for big data systems and visual analytics to 
                  answer these questions and support climbing as a form of sport and recreation. 
                  This project seeks to build a visual analytics system to help climbers build 
                  their skills with achievable, challenging recommendations.")

                    skill level. This RS will be built by clustering similar users together using several climbing metrics in order to help 
                    the user improve their climbing skills. This project will benefit rock climbers of all skill levels by identifying climbing 
                    routes that are custom-tailored to their individual interests and skill level. The Mountain Project has a large number of

text5 <- c("This project falls into the general category of designing RSs. RSs are subclasses of information filtering systems that seek to predict the 'rating' or 'preference' 
            a user would give to an item. The study of RSs is relatively new compared to other classical information system tools and techniques. 
            The topic emerged as a research area in the mid-1990s (Goldberg, 1992). 
            Among different techniques, collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular of these strategies due to its domain-free nature (Dean, 2014). CF is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating).")
text6 <- c("Shardanand and Maes (1995) designed a CF system for music (Ringo) and experimented with a number of measures of distance between users. They compared four different recommendation algorithms based on the Mean Absolute Error of predictions. Throughout the 2000s, RSs primarily focused on singular value decomposition systems, restricted Boltzmann machines, and neighborhood models to create user recommendations. Early RSs developed by Linden et al. (2003) used item-to-item CF, which finds items that have been purchased in tandem and have high similarity, and then recommends one item of the pair to a user who is purchasing or has purchased the other item in the pair. With regards to the project, this would be similar to using data regarding climbing routes and finding similar routes that have been done close in time. Also, Salakhutdinov et al. (2007) proposed restricted Boltzmann machines which essentially use a two-layer neural network that works similarly to an autoencoder by which latent features are learned by the network. Koren (2008) discussed the combination of latent factor and neighborhood recommendations to improve recommendation accuracy on the Netflix dataset. He provides a unique evaluation other than accuracy (RMSE) for the recommendation model by evaluating the top-k recommended items against items that are already highly rated (5-star). Both Salakhutdinov et al. and Koren provide foundational models by which to build our recommender system and metrics with which we can evaluate our models.")
text7 <- c("Shortly after, Koren et al. (2009) published on matrix factorization models that also incorporate normalization, item bias, and user bias to provide accurate recommendations. Cleger-Tamayo et al. (2010) uses a news recommendation sample problem to expand on clustering techniques that can be applied to CF methods. The sample shows how to formulate the calculation for the memory-based clustering algorithm which learns quickly, but is slow to make predictions. The memory-based algorithms predict a user rating for a particular item by using a similarity-weighted sum of the other user ratings. These predictions use the nearest K neighbors method or collaborative filter based on users. We will test our calculation algorithm based on memory and will optimize the algorithm by caching the predictions. Gannod et al. (2019) used a collaborative filtering method whereby recommendations were made using preferences and specified interests of nursing home residents to suggest person-centered care using association rules. While the authors’ sample size was only 255 residents, their recall and precision were both roughly 80%. The methods demonstrated in this paper contribute to the feasibility of the rock climbing project by illustrating ways to enhance preference capture.")
text8 <- c("Beyond CF, there exist alternative RSs that consider similarity distance (neighborhood-based) or explicit user preferences (content-based). Ye et al. (2018) describes how AirBNB uses analytics to suggest prices for listing hosts to optimize income. They split the problem into three parts: classification, regression based on class, and host personalization. This approach is limited to how effectively they can classify unique properties and understand their users. We can use parts of their approach, like personalizing recommendations beyond classification and regression based on how individual users have used the site. Christakopoulou et al. (2018) discusses how they collect user preferences with a chat bot to provide better recommendations to the user. This is limited by what the user prefers, but could be useful for tailoring our recommendations to users’ explicit inputs.")
text9 <- c("Other data sources such as geospatial data are used to make recommendations. Carmen, et al. (2015) provide an overview of Location-Aware RSs (LARS), grounding the mechanics of these systems in mobile computing. LARS utilizes geo-referenced data in order to provide recommendations to target consumers effectively and efficiently; this paper enumerates ways in which the rock climbing RS can use geo-referenced data effectively inside the GUI. Vías et al. (2018) describes a RS to manage the use of protected parks. Utilizing network analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis, and GIS, they determined that 34% of hikes in the mountain range were considered viable for hikers. This paper provides a foundation for outdoor recreation viability which lays the foundation for rock climbing RS in its methods and analysis. However, the authors’ RS is limited in that it focuses on viability rather than custom training routes, which is the primary goal of the rock climbing RS. An alternative approach would be the use of sentiment analysis to classify reviews as illustrated by Glorot et al. (2011). Sentiment analysis is limited by its ability to understand the user’s input which could be a significant limiting factor in areas such as climbing terminology, but could ultimately help distinguish between comparable routes.")
text10 <- c("Data visualization is another issue of the usability of product design. Karni and Shapira (2013) present an interactive visualization for RSs which enables a user to easily locate other users sharing similar interests. Given a user entity within a network, the system draws a graphical layout with users and interests that reflect relevance and similarity to the central user entity, a technique we can emulate in our project.")
text11 <- c("Through this review, CF has shown to be the dominant form of RSs. This technique will serve as a baseline for our model development. Blended models have historically performed with lower error rates (e.g. Netflix prize winners) so a combination of modern RSs that incorporate sentiment analysis, GIS data, and explicit user inputs to an application as presented prior will be tested in hopes of creating better quality recommendations than a CF model alone.")
